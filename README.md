Standard API includes all of the locale and formatting information from the Basic API and returns extra data about the type of number, whether it is ported and the identity of the caller (US only).

The Advanced API provides the most comprehensive data. It includes everything that is available in the Basic and Standard APIs and adds roaming and reachability information.
 the Advanced API is intended to be used asynchronously.

 typical use cases
 Basic API: Discovering which country a number belongs to and using the information to format the number correctly.
Standard API: Determining whether the number is a landline or mobile number (to choose between voice and SMS contact) and blocking virtual numbers.
Advanced API: Ascertaining the risk associated with a number.
